# CapgeminiWeatherStationiOSApp
Weather Box was born from partnership with Capgemini. What we have in mind is an eco-friendly weather monitoring solution. We’re focusing on low consumption and optimization. Therefore we’re creating a portable and autonomous station that can be setup anywhere. Our station can be compared to a Nivose, even though it costs 70 times less! It’s able to collect precious data on the current forecast such as temperature, pressure, humidity or snow level.
